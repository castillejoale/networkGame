/** 
* This class will have the squares that make up our GameBoard.  Each GameBoard is 8x8, so there are always 64 Squares in each instance
* of a Gameboard.  A Square records the color of a given square of the GameBoard, represented by an int.
* -1 means the square is unoccupied, and doesn't have a chip on it.  0 means there is a black chip on the square.  1 means there is a white
* chip on the square.

* Another note: board[i][j] references a Square.  After a Move has been played, we need to have a line like the following:
* board[i][j].setColor(color);
* -1 = unoccupied
* 0 = black
* 1 = white
